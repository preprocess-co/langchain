# Preprocess Loader

[Preprocess](https://preprocess.co) is an API service that splits any kind of document into optimal chunks of text for use in language model tasks.
Given documents in input `Preprocess` splits them into chunks of text that respect the layout and semantics of the original document.
We split the content by taking into account sections, paragraphs, lists, images, data tables, text tables, and slides, and following the content semantics for long texts.
We support PDFs, Microsoft Office documents (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), OpenOffice documents (ods, odt, odp), HTML content (web pages, articles, emails), and plain text.

This loader integrates with the `Preprocess` API library to provide document conversion and chunking or to load already chunked files inside LlamaIndex.

## Installation and Setup
Install the Python `Preprocess` library if it is not already present:

```bash
pip install pypreprocess
```

## Usage

To use this loader, you need to pass the `Preprocess API Key`. 
When initializing `PreprocessReader`, you should pass your `API Key`, if you don't have it yet, please ask for one at [support@preprocess.co](mailto:support@preprocess.co). Without an `API Key`, the loader will raise an error.

To chunk a file pass a valid filepath and the reader will start converting and chunking it.
`Preprocess` will chunk your files by applying an internal `Splitter`.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PreprocessLoader

#pass a filepath and get the chunks as nodes
loader = PreprocessReader(api_key='your-api-key', filepath='valid/path/to/file')
documents = loader.load()
```

`load()` returns a document for each chunk, remember to not apply any splitting to these documents

If you want to load already chunked files you can do it via `process_id` passing it to the reader.
```python
#pass a process_id obtained from a previous instance and get the chunks as one string inside a Document
loader = PreprocessReader(api_key='your-api-key', process_id='your-process-id')
```

## Other info

`PreprocessReader` is based on `pypreprocess` from [Preprocess](https://github.com/preprocess-co/pypreprocess) library.
